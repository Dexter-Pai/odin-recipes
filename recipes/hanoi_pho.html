    <p>
        Ha Noi Pho is ALL about the beef broth. Thereâ€™s NO sriracha, NO hoisin sauce, and minimal garnishes.
    </p>
    <p>
        typically features a clear and aromatic beef broth, slow-cooked with a combination of beef bones, spices, and herbs.

    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>Get about six to seven pounds of beef bones, add them to your stock pot, add filtered water to cover (about 6-7 quarts) and bring the water to a boil. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface and reduce the heat to a gentle, slow simmer.</li>
        <li>Cut the onion or shallots in half. Slice unpeeled ginger in half lengthwise. Char ginger and onion on a grill, gas stovetop or by broiling in the oven. Watch closely, turn on occasion and remove from the oven after about 10-15 minutes. Once charred, remove from the heat for a few minutes to let them cool. Remove the outer skin from the onion/shallots and peel the ginger. Remove any blackened pieces and add them to the beef broth.</li>
        <li>Add dried shrimp, cinnamon, star anise, fennel seeds and cardamom pods. Cover and keep the broth gently simmering for four to six hours.</li>
        <li>Take one fuji apple and peel and core it. Slice it up into chunks and add it to the broth.</li>
        <li>Strain the broth and if using right away, season with 2 TBSPs fish sauce. Add up to 2 TBSPs more, to taste. If not using right away, cool and store the broth in the fridge and season with fish sauce upon reheating.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the raw beef and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare rice noodles according to package directions.</li>
        <li>Prepare the garnishes and seasonings. Chop herbs coarsely or simple place whole leaves in bowls for individual garnishes. Place fish sauce and/or garlic vinegar in small condiment bowls.</li>
        <li>Place rice noodles in individual bowls, place raw beef (or other types of beef) on top and ladle over with hot broth. Add herbs and seasonings, to taste.</li>
